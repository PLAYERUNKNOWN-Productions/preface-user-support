## User Guide: A Guide for the Perplexed

_Preface: Undiscovered World_ is an experimental tech demo created by PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions to showcase the potential of Melba, our machine-learning-powered world-generation engine. PREFACE is not a game in the traditional sense - it’s a work in progress, a tool for discovery, and a platform for collaboration between developers and users.

If you’ve loaded _Preface_ and found yourself wondering, “Am I doing this right?” - don’t worry. You’re not alone, and you’re not doing it wrong. This guide is here to help you understand how to engage with the demo and contribute to our shared goal of exploring and improving this undiscovered world.

### Why _Preface_ Matters

PREFACE isn’t just about exploring a digital landscape. It’s about testing the limits of our world-generation technology, Melba, which creates a seamless, Earth-scale world in real time using only your GPU. [Learn more about the vision behind Preface in our launch article](https://go.pp.studio/PrefaceLaunch).

Because the world is procedurally generated by machine learning, even we as developers don’t know what’s out there. This is where you come in. By simply exploring, you help us understand how Preface performs across different devices. By interacting with the demo, you help us discover hidden gems, find artifacts of interest, and identify areas where the world feels most alive (or need improvement).

### How You Can Engage

There are two primary ways to interact with PREFACE that make a meaningful impact:

#### 1. Taking Photos

PREFACE includes a Postcard Function that allows you to capture and label views from the generated world. These photos are automatically shared with our team, helping us evaluate:
- Which areas feel most compelling or realistic.
- What types of terrain or structures work well.
- The visual fidelity of different elements in the world.

![ss_46ea0a3acf346a56671a9fa0e48a290a795c9848 1920x1080](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a005f70f-2d6c-443b-80e2-936986de2dc6)

**To take a photo:**
1. Explore the terrain until you find a location that interests you.
1. Use the Postcard Function to capture a snapshot.
1. Optionally, add a label or rating to provide additional context.
Each photo you take helps us improve the Melba engine and refine our techniques.

#### 2. Setting Waypoints

The Waypoint System lets you save points of interest as you explore. Whether it’s a particularly striking vista, an unusual terrain feature, or something you’re unsure of, marking these locations helps us understand what’s worth revisiting.

We use your waypoints to:
- Identify areas of the world that require further investigation.
- Analyze how users navigate and engage with the space.
- Collect data on features that resonate with players or need enhancement.

![ss_fda5412dc187ba39a60c3cb76723217615bc7d86 1920x1080](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfc21cbb-7009-41c9-b6c9-ae2bffab1f47)

**To set a waypoint:**
1. Find a location you want to mark.
1. Use the in-game waypoint tool to save it.
1. Continue exploring, or revisit your saved locations.

### Why Just Loading the Demo Helps

Even if you don’t take photos or set waypoints, simply [downloading _Preface_ on Steam](preface.pp.studio), loading, and running it provides us with valuable telemetry. This data allows us to:
- Test PREFACE’s compatibility across a range of hardware configurations.
- Monitor performance metrics, such as frame rates and GPU utilization.
- Identify devices or setups where the demo struggles, helping us optimize the experience.
So whether you spend hours exploring or just take a quick look around, your participation contributes to the development of _Preface_ and Melba.

### Looking for More?
