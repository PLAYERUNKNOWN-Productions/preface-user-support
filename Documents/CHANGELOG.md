# Changelog

## v0.3.0
### Upgrade notes

    * This is required if you participated in the Discord-only `beta` program.
### Known Issues
* Some leaking DX12 resources
* Ray tracing has some issues - especially with night-time lighting
* Flying close to the ocean can occasionally cull an ocean tile, revealing terrain underneath

  * Note: Run the updated app once to enable the feature and close it every time you want to switch planet
  * Deeplinks: you can jump straight to a planet via the `planet_name` url parameter (works with bookmarks)
* Oceans
  * We’ve added our first iteration of planet-scale water – oceans now appear on planets, bringing us one step closer to a living Earth-like world
  * This works on any size of planet
  * In User Mode, the ocean will prevent the user from flying into it with a minimum altitude
* Upscalers updated:
  * AMD FSR 2.0.0
  * NVIDIA DLSS 310.4.0

* Planets of very different sizes now behave consistently (terrain, population density, grass, shadows, ocean rendering)
* Visual fidelity
  * Better-looking impostors (Night/dusk lighting on impostors is more correct)
  * LOD cross-fading: smoother transitions between LODs
* Ray tracing: no longer experimental
### Fixes
* Quad-tree splitting heuristics: more consistent LOD, fewer stalls; neighboring tiles won’t block splits
* General stability: fewer resource stalls during tile/asset updates
* Crash reports include more relevant log files
* Asset pipeline fixes & improvements
### Stability & Diagnostics
* GPU crash dumps enabled only on NVIDIA cards (no more bad captures on unsupported GPUs)

  * Entity ownership
  * Demos for the above


## v0.2.2

### Features

* Population (trees/rocks/etc.) rendering has had its limit greatly increased - leading to a great improvement in vista rendering.
  * Note: there should only be a minor decrease in performance. If you notice a big regression, please file a bug.

### Fixes

* Various developer tool fixes for working with FSR/DLSS upscaling enabled.
* Asset factory - moved importing to async jobs to retain GUI responsiveness.
* Fixes with ML generating textures that are "out of range" causing "stripy" terrain.
* Fix for clients generating a "null" ID from an empty string hash for analytics.
* Optimisations for instancing cameras to share defines in a better way.
* Avoid converting to wstring for debug names alongside the D3D12 API border - leading to a slight perf bump.
* Don't allow our time devgui to select a time before Midnight, January 1st, 1970 - the world did not exist before that.
* Imposter rendering now uses the correct shadow filtering - avoiding a harsh contrast with fully instanced assets.

### Invisible and Upcoming Work

* Restructuring the entire project to use "more modern CMake" - WIP.

## v0.1.6

### Known Issues

* Switching to Windowed mode from Borderless Fullscreen can cause the title bar to be out of your monitor's resolution
    * This is already fixed internally and will be fixed with the next patch
* The current texture upsampling model generates some artifacts, rainbow-coloured areas. This will be fixed next model updates.
* There are noticeable seams along the quadtree borders at large scale. This is caused by the basemaps currently not being seamless. There will be a new update of the basemap with seamless borders.
 
### Features

* Added a fixed altitude flying camera mode (Q/E keys and gamepad)
    * Prevent waypoint requests whilst above a certain altitude to avoid network saturation
* LOD/Impostor transition
    * Impostors now consistently appear once you exceed the farthest geometric LOD, avoiding sudden disappearances in distant scenery.
* Log Driver Version
    * We now log the user's driver version on startup, as this information can help us understand and fix bugs
      
### Fixes

* Addressed several shutdown, invalid-entity, and concurrency edge cases
* Rendering
    * Fixed motion vectors and perspective-correct velocity calculations
    * Motion Blur: Correctly handles colour and velocity buffers of different sizes
    * Correctly clears and updates sorted instance counters for occlusion
    * Improved performance of Atmospheric Scattering by slightly reducing sample counts
* Planet
    * Properly applies configured planet radius (removes hard-coded Earth radius)
        * Resolved far-plane NaN issues at small planet sizes
        * There are still a lot of known issues for non-earth sized planets

    * Removed or refactored deprecated systems (e.g. old texture load, physics, sim-state)
    * Consolidated typed entity-access APIs for simpler and safer ECS usage
* Prototypes
    * Note: some prototypes require compile-time changes and cannot be enabled through SQL configuration - but others can.
    * Oceans
    * Height and Distance Fog
    * Using the Docking branch for Dear ImGui - allowing developer UI to be moved outside the main window


## v0.1.5

### Known Issues

* Multi monitor setups may show the window on the wrong monitor.
* Windowed mode allows setting a too large resolution, which does not fit on screen. Use alt-enter to fix it.
* Sometimes when switching display mode and resolution simultaneously, the resolution will not be applied.

### Features

* Added LUT-based color correction, allowing custom color grading based on screenshots in the future. (PST-2131)
* Added a new API for logging and asserts which should improve detection of issues (PST-2006)

### Fixes

* Rendering Improvements
    * Instancing & occlusion optimizations
    * Optimized atmospheric scattering, reducing render time by up to 0.5ms (PST-1890)
* Stability Improvements
    * Fixed incorrect handling of resource counts in the rendering abstraction layer
    * Early exit mechanism added to prevent crashes when the GPU device is unavailable
    * Improved handling of minimum VRAM requirements to ensure compatibility with lower-end hardware.

### Invisible Work

* More work has been done to reduce tech debt following the first release and help prepare for future work.

## v0.1.4

### Known Issues

* Multi monitor setups may show the window on the wrong monitor.
* Windowed mode allows setting a too large resolution, which does not fit on screen. Use alt-enter to fix it.
* Sometimes when switching display mode and resolution simultaneously, the resolution will not be applied.

### Features

* You can now set resolution in borderless fullscreen.

### Fixes

* Performance:
  * Improved Atmospheric Scattering frametime by 33% by using float16 for the LUT format.
* Logging:
  * Fix a bug where long messages are truncated.
  * Redesigned and simplified a bunch of internal APIs around logging which should improve quality of logs.
* UI:
  * Scale the "Confirm" button in the postcard interface with the resolution.
* Crashes:
  * Avoid a highly annoying crash where we can set the screenshot readback buffer to not match the swapchain size.
    * This one was tricky to hunt down because many graphics cards don't crash, despite it being clearly wrong.
  * Improved unsupported hardware detection to use hardware features instead of names.
  
### Invisible Work

* A large amount of work has been done to reduce tech debt following the first release and help prepare for future work.
